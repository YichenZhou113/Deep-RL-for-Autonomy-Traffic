# Deep-RL-for-Autonomy-Traffic
Pixel-Learning with Deep RL for Autonomy Traffic

This Project is trying to prototype the Flow Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for autonomy traffic on real robotic vehicles. In the experiment setting, we used 18 MBots for emulating the human drivers and 2 Jetson Bots to emulate the autonomous vehicles.
